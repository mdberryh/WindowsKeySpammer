# WindowsKeySpammer
A C# application, which uses windows DLLs to spam the string or keys, which the user specifies.

Eventually I would like to be able to spam mouse actions and queue additional actions. For example, it would be nice to create a list of actions to spam, while returning the mouse pointer back to the user inbetween. It should try to allow the user to use the system while key actions are occuring in the desired window. Until then...this is a simple demo of how to use windows DLLs and send keys.
